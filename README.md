# Accomdemy Learn 

Accomdemy is a self-learning community formed by a group of partners from the science and technology circle, the innovation circle, and the education circle. We are a non-profit organization focusing solely on furthering our learners’ understanding. 

We believe that education and technology allow people to chase their passions and make the world a better place; and we believe that the best learning method is backed by self-motivation, so we call on those with the same beliefs to contribute their strengths together. We hope those who want to learn but don’t have the resources can enjoy the joy of learning via our online sharing sessions and via receiving real-time advice from experienced mentors.


Made by community with ❤️.
