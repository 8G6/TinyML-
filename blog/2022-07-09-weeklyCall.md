The Weekly call started by getting to know the [ESP-C3 Dev module from DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2566.html), and we had great discussions on LoRa, Thread and Matter protocols.

Muhammed Zain Shared his [wild fire prediction project](https://zainmfd.github.io/FightFire/), which uses LoRa radio communication methods to transfer the information and [LoCom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hIDE8acqhQ&feature=youtu.be), That is build for remote communities for emergency communication. 
![wild fire prediction project](https://zainmfd.github.io/FightFire/img/28.jpg), and Travis shared a project called [One Planet Education](https://www.oneplaneteducation.com/) where the LoCom project can be helpful and shared a similer project called [Off-grid LoRa Communicator](https://hackaday.io/project/183966-off-grid-lora-communicator) that similar to LoCom. 

Travis then shared about the [open thread project](https://openthread.io/) and [maker youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThatProject), and that led the discussion to [ESP-NOW Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmvMtgNs9r8)
