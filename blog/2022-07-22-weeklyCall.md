We discussed various topics, including Paul's "building nuclear fusion?" thread on the #random channel. And I also found one related video from Youtube randomly [Why Private Billions Are Flowing Into Fusion]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp6W7g9no0w). It was an excellent documentary, explaining the possibility and needs of fusion energy. 


Then we discussed the Node-RED platform and the ease of making complex with them. Zain shared about 'node' that can do computer vision. It was the "[node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange)"
